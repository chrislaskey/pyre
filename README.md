## Pyre

LLM framework for rapid development in Elixir.

> I'd like to iterate Pyre, an LLM framework generating Elixir apps. The idea
> behind this framework is to allow us to build production-ready Elixir Phoenix
> applications. Key ideas are that we will use multiple LLM agents, each with
> their own persona - product, designer, programmer, test writer, reviewer.
> Features will be developed by going through each of the personas. One of the
> limitations of LLMs is the training data they learn on is wide and varied, so
> each time they attempt to write code for a task it is often in a different
> style and architecture. To help combat this, I've had a lot of positive
> success using more deterministic methods like code generators and agent
> skills for specific tasks.
